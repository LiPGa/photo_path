# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to the Gemini AI assistant when working with the code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React 19 + TypeScript photography progress tracking app ("PhotoPath") built with Vite. It uses the Gemini AI API for photo analysis and critique.

The application allows users to upload photos, receive an AI-powered analysis of their work, and track their progress over time. The analysis includes scores on a 10-point scale for various photographic elements, as well as qualitative feedback and suggestions for improvement.

### Core Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-3-flash-preview` model)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
*   **Authentication:** Supabase (Email/Password + Google OAuth)
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)

### Architecture

The application is structured into two main views:

*   **Evaluation View:** Handles photo uploads, EXIF data extraction, and displays the AI-powered analysis results.
*   **Archives View:** A timeline of all analyzed photos, with a detail view for each entry.

State management is handled through a combination of React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useTransition`) and custom hooks for specific concerns like photo analysis (`usePhotoAnalysis`), daily usage limits (`useDailyUsage`), and image caching (`useImageCache`).

User authentication is managed through a `AuthContext` that provides a `useAuth` hook for accessing user and session data.

Data persistence for logged-in users is handled by a `dataService` that performs CRUD operations on the Supabase database. Guest users' data is stored in the component state and is lost on refresh.

## Building and Running

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev

# Build the application for production
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

### Environment Setup

Set environment variables in a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# Gemini API Key (Required)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Mock Mode - Skips the API call and returns mock data for local testing (Optional)
VITE_MOCK_API=true

# Supabase - For user authentication and data persistence (Optional)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**Note:** For local development, it is recommended to set `VITE_MOCK_API=true` to conserve your API quota.

## Development Conventions

### Coding Style

*   The codebase follows standard TypeScript and React conventions.
*   Functional components with hooks are used throughout the application.
*   The project uses lazy loading for the main view components (`EvaluationView` and `ArchivesView`) to improve initial load times.
*   Memoization is used for some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
*   The project uses a custom hook `usePhotoAnalysis` to manage the state of the photo analysis process.
